# Finnish-train-compositions-viewer

This an Angular 1.x mini project that gets live data of local trains from open source API service provided by Finnish Transport Agency (https://rata.digitraffic.fi/api/v1/doc/index.html).

The main functionality includes: select a specific city station in Finland to display information of trains' compositions which pass by the station and showing which trains are currently moving, which ones are not. There is a total of 536 stations across Finland to select.

The completed product is supposed to look like the image in the screenshot folder.
